# IPL_Data_Analysis_Spark

We are going to analyze IPL data by building a data pipeline, main focus of this Project is to focus on writing Apache Spark code and different functions to perform transformation


We use Databricks Workspace to run the code using PySpark. Create an account in DataBricks as a Community Edition and create a new community for the Project with Python as interpretor. Run the Code cells one by one to get the desired Outputs. You can also change the codes as per Your requirements.
